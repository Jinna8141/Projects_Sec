**Zip Password Cracker**

This Python script attempts to crack the password of a ZIP file using a provided wordlist.

**Installation:**

1. **Install Python:** Ensure you have Python installed on your system. Download it from [https://www.python.org/downloads/](https://www.python.org/downloads/) if needed.
2. **Install Required Libraries:** 
   - Open a terminal or command prompt.
   - Install the required libraries using pip:
   ```bash
   pip install zipfile tqdm
   ```

**Usage:**

1. **Download the script:** Clone this repository or download the script file.
2. **Prepare Files:**
   - Place the ZIP file you want to crack in the same directory as the script.
   - Create a wordlist file containing potential passwords, one password per line. Save it as "custom_wordlist.txt" in the same directory.
3. **Run the script:** Open a terminal or command prompt in the script's directory and execute the following command:
   ```bash
   python zip_cracker.py
   ```

**Output:**

The script will display:

- The total number of passwords to test.
- A progress bar indicating the cracking progress.
- If the password is found, it will be printed to the console.
- If the password is not found, a message will be displayed suggesting to try a different wordlist.

**Ethical Considerations:**

- Use this script only for ethical purposes, such as recovering your own lost passwords.
- Do not attempt to crack passwords of files you do not have permission to access.
- Be aware that password cracking can be time-consuming, especially for strong passwords or large wordlists.

**Additional Notes:**

- Consider using more comprehensive wordlists for better cracking chances.
- For stronger ZIP encryption, this script may not be effective.
- Explore alternative password cracking tools for complex scenarios.
